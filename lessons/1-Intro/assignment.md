# Game Jam

Games are an area that have been heavily influence by developments in AI and ML. In this assignment, write a short paper on a game that you like that has been influenced by the evolution of AI. It should be an old enough game to have been influenced by several types of computer processing systems. A good example is Chess or Go, but also take a look at video games like pong or Pac-Man. Write an essay that discusses the game's past, present, and AI future.

League of Legends has consumed my life for the better part of a decade. I'm under the assumption that AI doesn't have any real employees and the company is just running on AI with the CEO just inputting ideas and the AI outputting the ideas into the game. 

New cosmetic content? 

Input: 
"We need more weeb skins"

Output: 
"The 100th skin line in a row with Anime influences"

Input:
"Let's create a new champion."

Output:
"Fan servicey, not ugly champion"

Input:
"Mr. AI, please balance the game properly"

Output: 
"Sorry, even I can't fulfill this request."

CEO Response:
"No problem at all. We're not in the business of making good games."

With that said, I look forward to another decade of playing this awful game.
